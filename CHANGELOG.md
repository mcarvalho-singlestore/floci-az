and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **core:** error responses to `HEAD` requests no longer advertise a `Content-Type`. A HEAD response
  carries no body (RFC 9110 §9.3.2), but the content type was still set, leaving
  `content-type: application/xml` (or `application/json`) on a zero-byte response. The Azure SDK for
  C++ parses an error body whenever the content type contains `xml`/`json` without checking that the
  buffer is non-empty, so the resulting `std::runtime_error` escaped the `RequestFailedException`
  constructor and called `terminate()`, crashing any C++ caller that did a `Get Blob Properties` on a
  missing blob instead of surfacing a 404. Matches Azurite, which gates both the content type and the
  body on the request method. `x-ms-error-code` is still returned (it is the SDK's documented fallback),
  `GET` error responses keep the full `<Error>` document, and successful `HEAD` responses keep their
  documented `Content-Type` ([#184](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/184))

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- **blob (ADLS):** user delegation key vending — `POST /?restype=service&comp=userdelegationkey`
  behind bearer auth returns the spec-exact `UserDelegationKey` XML with a deterministic
  per-account signing key, and ARM storage accounts expose the `dfs` primary endpoint, so
  `azure-storage-file-datalake` clients can mint and use user-delegation SAS end to end ([#122](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/122))
- **mysql / mariadb:** Azure Database for MySQL (Flexible Server, `Microsoft.DBforMySQL/flexibleServers`)
  and Azure Database for MariaDB (Single Server, `Microsoft.DBforMariaDB/servers`) emulation — server
  CRUD, databases, firewall rules, configurations, checkNameAvailability, and a `/connect`
  convenience endpoint, backed by real `mysql:8.0` / `mariadb:10.11` sidecar containers with
  protocol-handshake readiness, admin grants matching a real Azure admin, in-place `ALTER USER`
  password rotation, and container rehydration after emulator restarts; plus a cross-resource
  Monitor **diagnostic settings** extension (`{resourceUri}/providers/microsoft.insights/diagnosticSettings`).
  Continues [#104](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/104) with original authorship preserved
- **cosmos:** custom container indexing policies with Azure-parity composite-index enforcement. A client-supplied `indexingPolicy` (included/excluded paths, composite indexes) on container create is normalized the way Azure does (defaults filled, composite path `order` defaulting to `ascending`), persisted, and returned on container read; container **replace** (`PUT /dbs/{db}/colls/{coll}`) is now supported for updating the policy, with `id` and `partitionKey` immutable as in Azure. Queries with an `ORDER BY` over two or more properties (or mixed sort directions) now fail with `400 BadRequest` ("The order by query does not have a corresponding composite index that it can be served from", code `SC2104`) unless the container has a composite index matching the clause exactly — same paths, same sequence, same length, directions matching exactly or all-inverted — so queries that would be rejected in production fail locally too ([#127](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/127))
- **Network**: realistic property synthesis for `Microsoft.Network` load balancers
  (top-level `sku` round-trip, frontend/rule/pool ARM IDs), network security groups
  (rule IDs, the six real-Azure `defaultSecurityRules`, standalone `securityRules`
  child endpoint), and application gateways (child sub-resource IDs,
  `operationalState`), plus the `backendAddressPools` child endpoint — enabling
  `azurerm_lb*`, `azurerm_network_security_*`, and `azurerm_application_gateway`
  Terraform/OpenTofu flows.
- **servicebus:** subscription rules and topic filters — the `/{topic}/subscriptions/{sub}/rules[/{rule}]` management-plane endpoints (create/get/list/delete, ATOM `RuleDescription` wire format with `CorrelationFilter`/`SqlFilter`/`TrueFilter`/`FalseFilter` and `SqlRuleAction` bodies), Azure's implicit `$Default` TrueFilter rule (auto-created per subscription, replaceable via the delete-then-add SDK flow or a `DefaultRuleDescription` in the subscription create body), and broker-side filter evaluation: rules compile to Artemis SQL92 queue selectors (`CorrelationId`→`JMSCorrelationID`, `Label`/`Subject`→`JMSType`, `SessionId`→`JMSXGroupID`, application properties by name, with typed int/long/double/boolean correlation values), multiple rules OR-combine into a single delivery, no rules delivers nothing, and rule changes update the queue filter in place (`updateQueue`) without dropping routed messages or kicking receivers. Filters on `MessageId`/`To`/`ReplyTo`/`ReplyToSessionId`/`ContentType` are rejected with 400 (no broker-side AMQP mapping); `SqlRuleAction` is stored/echoed but not applied to delivered messages ([#124](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/124))
- **docker:** every emulator-created container and volume is now labelled `floci=true`
  (umbrella across the Floci emulators) and `floci_emulator=floci-az` (per-emulator
  discriminator), applied centrally in the container lifecycle layer — so
  `docker ps --filter label=floci_emulator=floci-az` and
  `docker volume prune --filter label=floci_emulator=floci-az` target this emulator
  alone, while `label=floci=true` still matches all Floci emulators. The `floci-az-`
  name prefix is now owned by a single naming helper instead of being spelled at each
  call site (container names are unchanged), the Functions runtime container is created
  through the shared container layer (it previously bypassed it and carried no labels),
  and the AKS k3s volume is created explicitly so it is labelled too. New optional
  `floci-az.docker.resource-namespace` (`FLOCI_AZ_DOCKER_RESOURCE_NAMESPACE`) inserts a
  namespace into child container/volume names (`floci-az-<ns>-...`) and a
  `floci_namespace` label, for running multiple emulator processes against one Docker
  daemon. Docker volume labels are immutable, so volumes created by earlier versions
  keep no labels until recreated (the AKS k3s volume is deleted on shutdown by default,
  so this resolves itself); such volumes can be listed with
  `docker volume ls --filter name=floci-az-` and removed manually if needed. Note: with a namespace set, the Event Hubs broker certificate SAN
  (`floci-az-artemis`) does not cover the namespaced container name for in-network TLS
  clients — connect via `localhost` in that setup.

### Fixed

- **storage:** blob, queue, and table service-properties requests now return proper
  `StorageServiceProperties` XML with spec-correct statuses (Get 200 / Set 202) instead of a
  Java `toString` body ([#131](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/131),
  [#132](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/132))
- **blob:** unimplemented `comp` operations on `PUT /{container}/{blob}` (lease, snapshot,
  properties, tier, tags, page, appendblock) and header-discriminated CopyBlob / Data Lake
  rename no longer fall through to PutBlob — previously they replaced the blob content with
  the (usually empty) request body and answered 201; they now return `501 NotImplemented`
  in the Azure error shape ([#155](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/155))
- **servicebus:** the CBS responder no longer exhausts file descriptors when the broker is
  unreachable — the reconnect backoff sat in a catch block that Proton's normally-returning
  `reactor.run()` never reached, so the loop re-created reactors (and their selectors/pipes)
  at CPU speed ([#154](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/154))
- **email:** the ACS Email send operation now matches the real operation contract so the
  Azure SDKs can poll a send to completion ([#148](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/148))
- **core:** unified ARM provider dispatch with strict ARM body parsing ([#118](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/118));
  bare Key Vault deleted-* collection routes resolve and disabled services report `503` ([#114](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/114))
- **servicebus:** ATOM feed responses (queues/topics/subscriptions list) no longer embed an XML prolog inside every `<entry>`, which made the feed malformed XML for strict parsers
- **tls:** the emulator now starts with `FLOCI_AZ_TLS_ENABLED=true` on Windows hosts. `TlsConfigSource` fed native backslash paths into `quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.*`, and SmallRye Config treats backslashes in property values as escape characters, so startup died with `NoSuchFileException: D:Devfloci-az.datatls...`. Certificate and key paths (generated and user-provided) are now emitted with forward slashes on Windows, which the Windows file APIs accept; on other platforms paths are passed through untouched since a backslash is a legal filename character there
- **blob:** `Get Blob` / `Get Blob Properties` now return the `x-ms-creation-time`, `x-ms-lease-status`, `x-ms-lease-state`, and `x-ms-server-encrypted` response headers that Azure always sends, and `Get Container Properties` now returns `x-ms-lease-state` / `x-ms-lease-status`. The Azure SDK for C++ (`azure-storage-blobs` 12.18.0) reads these unconditionally (`std::map::at()`) when deserialising Download, GetProperties, and GetContainerProperties responses, so their absence threw `std::out_of_range` and crashed the client process; the Java, Python, and Node SDKs map them to nullable fields and were unaffected, which is why the existing compatibility suites stayed green. Creation time is now recorded when a blob is written and preserved across metadata updates and overwrites, so it no longer tracks last-modified. Leases remain unmodelled: the lease headers report the fixed values of an unleased blob or container. `Content-Range` is also no longer sent on full (`200 OK`) downloads, matching the Azure spec, which scopes it to range requests ([#145](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/145))

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- **managedidentity:** Managed Identity emulation (`Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities` + IMDS token endpoint) — HTTP-only with no Docker sidecar. ARM CRUD for user-assigned identities (server-generated `principalId`/`clientId`/`tenantId` GUIDs that stay stable across updates), `federatedIdentityCredentials` children (`issuer`/`subject`/`audiences`, as used by `azurerm_federated_identity_credential`), and the system-assigned read `GET /{scope}/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/identities/default` with deterministic per-scope GUIDs. Implements the **IMDS token endpoint** (`GET /metadata/identity/oauth2/token`, imds spec 2023-07-01): requires the `Metadata: true` header, resolves an identity by `client_id`/`object_id`/`msi_res_id` (or synthesizes the system-assigned identity when no selector is given), and returns the all-string IMDS response shape with a v1.0 JWT (`appid`, `oid`, `idtyp=app`) signed by the Entra key — verifiable against the emulator JWKS. Compatible with the `azure-identity` `ManagedIdentityCredential` (Java, Python, Node.js) by pointing `AZURE_POD_IDENTITY_AUTHORITY_HOST` at the emulator. The system-assigned IMDS identity's scope is configurable via `services.managed-identity.system-assigned-scope` so token `oid` claims can match `identities/default` reads, and identities appear in the resource group's `/resources` listing for azurerm's pre-delete emptiness check. Enabled by default; Java + Python + Node.js compatibility suites wired into `compat-docker` and CI ([#61](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/61))
- **network:** Azure Private Endpoint and Private DNS emulation (`Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints`, `privateDnsZones`, `privateLinkServices`) so Terraform/SDK clients that declare Private Link + private DNS plumbing apply cleanly. Private DNS zones support CreateOrUpdate/Get/Delete/List with a default SOA record set seeded on creation, record sets (A/AAAA/CNAME/MX/PTR/SOA/SRV/TXT) with ETag (`If-Match`/`If-None-Match`) concurrency, and `virtualNetworkLinks` (reporting `virtualNetworkLinkState: "Completed"`); record-set and link counts are tracked on the zone. Private endpoints auto-approve their `privateLinkServiceConnections`, synthesize a backing network interface with a `10.0.0.4` private IP, and support nested `privateDnsZoneGroups`; deleting an endpoint cascades the synthesized NIC and zone groups. Private link services echo their config with a synthesized `alias`. All resource types are ARM-state only (no real private-link traffic or DNS resolution), gated by the existing `network.enabled` flag with no routing changes. Compatibility: `@QuarkusTest` lifecycle coverage in `NetworkHandlerTest`, a `PrivateLinkCompatibilityTest` Java SDK suite, and `azurerm_private_dns_zone` / `azurerm_private_dns_zone_virtual_network_link` / `azurerm_private_endpoint` resources in the Terraform and OpenTofu suites ([#60](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/60))

### Fixed

- **core (reset):** `POST /_admin/reset` now clears every state-holding service via CDI self-registration (a new `Resettable` interface). Previously the reset dispatched to a hand-maintained handler list that silently omitted API Management and Communication Email, so their state survived a reset used for test isolation ([#107](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/107))
- **acr:** the shared container registry sidecar is now restarted if it dies or is removed after its first start, and the readiness poller recovers a registry stuck in `provisioningState: Creating`. Previously a dead sidecar left every subsequent registry pending forever, timing out azurerm/OpenTofu applies ([#108](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/108))

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **eventgrid:** Azure Event Grid emulation (`Microsoft.EventGrid/topics` + `eventSubscriptions`) — the Azure counterpart of EventBridge/SNS, HTTP-only with no Docker sidecar. Custom Topic lifecycle (CreateOrUpdate, Get, Delete, List by resource group and subscription) returning a data-plane `properties.endpoint`, plus `listKeys`/`regenerateKey` (`{key1,key2}`). Classic scoped webhook `eventSubscriptions` with a `WebHook` destination and `filter` (`subjectBeginsWith`/`subjectEndsWith`/`includedEventTypes`/`isSubjectCaseSensitive`); creating one runs the `Microsoft.EventGrid.SubscriptionValidationEvent` handshake (or the CloudEvents `OPTIONS` abuse-protection probe). The data plane accepts `POST /{topic}-eventgrid/api/events` in both the **Event Grid** and **CloudEvents 1.0** schemas and fans matching events out to subscriber webhooks asynchronously, retried per the subscription's `retryPolicy` with exponential backoff; delivered events carry `topic` set to the topic resource id and the `aeg-event-type: Notification` header. Enabled by default. Compatibility: a `@QuarkusTest` covering ARM + publish + filtered delivery + validation, and a Java SDK suite (`azure-messaging-eventgrid`) wired into `make test-eventgrid`. WebHook destinations only; dead-lettering is best-effort (logged, not written to blob) ([#58](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/58))

### Fixed

- **blob (Data Lake / DFS):** route `{account}.dfs.core.windows.net` requests to the Blob handler so ADLS Gen2 / `azure-storage-file-datalake` clients resolve against the emulator ([#88](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/88))
- **blob:** `listBlobs` now honours the `delimiter` parameter, returning `<BlobPrefix>` elements for virtual directories (hierarchical listing) instead of a flat blob list ([#84](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/84))
- **blob:** invalid range requests now include the `Content-Range: bytes */{size}` header alongside the `416 InvalidRange` response, matching Azure ([#82](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/82))
- **servicebus:** resolve an index error and add host-based routing (`{account}.servicebus.windows.net`) plus root-level AtomPub / `$namespaceinfo` / `$Resources` request routing so Service Bus SDK management operations resolve ([#79](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/79))
- **banner:** list the Monitor and Email services in the startup banner's enabled-services output ([#92](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/92))

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **monitor:** Azure Monitor / Log Analytics emulation (`Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces` + `Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionEndpoints` + `dataCollectionRules`) — HTTP-only with no Docker sidecar. ARM CRUD for workspaces (generating a `customerId` GUID), Data Collection Endpoints, and Data Collection Rules (generating an `immutableId`). Implements the **Logs Ingestion API** (`POST /dataCollectionRules/{immutableId}/streams/{stream}`) which resolves the DCR's Log Analytics destination and stores each posted record against the destination workspace, and the **Log Analytics query API** (`POST /v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/query`) which runs a KQL subset (`where` with `==`/`!=`/`>`/`<`/`>=`/`<=`, `project`, `take`/`limit`, plus request-level `timespan` filtering on `TimeGenerated`) and returns the standard `{tables:[{name,columns,rows}]}` shape with inferred column types. Compatible with the `azure-monitor-ingestion` / `azure-monitor-query` SDKs. Enabled by default ([#68](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/68))
- **email:** Azure Communication Services Email emulation (`Microsoft.Communication` ARM plane + ACS Email data plane) — HTTP-only with no Docker sidecar. `POST /emails:send` accepts the full ACS payload and returns `202` with an `Operation-Location` header; `GET /emails/operations/{id}` reports the operation as `Succeeded`. Every message is **captured in-memory** (Mailpit-style) for test inspection via `GET /emailMessages`, `GET /emailMessages/{operationId}`, and `DELETE /emailMessages`; no real email is delivered. ARM CRUD for `communicationServices`, `emailServices`, and `emailServices/{name}/domains/{domain}`. Routed via the ACS host form `*.communication.azure.com`, the `/{account}-email/` suffix, and the ARM base URL. Compatible with the `azure-communication-email` SDK. Enabled by default ([#70](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/70))
- **vm:** Container-backed virtual machines (`floci-az.services.vm.mocked=false`). Each VM is backed by a long-lived Linux container (image resolved from `storageProfile.imageReference` via `VmImageResolver`, falling back to `ubuntu:22.04`) kept alive with `tail -f /dev/null`. Azure power actions map onto the container: `start` → docker start, `powerOff`/`deallocate` → docker stop (container retained), `restart`/`redeploy`/`reapply` → docker restart, delete → stop + remove. VMs provision asynchronously (`Creating` → `Succeeded` once the container is running, surfaced via a readiness poller) so SDK/Terraform LRO pollers complete. Docker failures degrade gracefully to mocked-style state and are never fatal. Mocked mode remains the default, so unit tests stay Docker-free.
- **entra:** Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) emulation — phase 1: a local OpenID Connect provider that replaces the previous static, unsigned-token stub. Issues real **RS256-signed** JWTs from a stable signing key persisted across restarts, serves an OpenID discovery document (`/.well-known/openid-configuration`) and JWKS (`/discovery/v2.0/keys`) derived from the request base URL, and handles the non-interactive grants **client credentials** and **resource-owner password (ROPC)** in both v1.0 and v2.0 token shapes. For closer Entra parity, app-only tokens carry the `idtyp=app` claim and every token carries a unique `uti`, the JWKS publishes the signing key's self-signed cert chain (`x5c`/`x5t`) alongside `n`/`e`, and token-endpoint errors use Azure's shape (`error_codes`, `trace_id`, `correlation_id`, `timestamp`, `error_uri`, and the `AADSTS` code in `error_description`). Seeds a default tenant (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002`) and a well-known dev app registration so `ClientSecretCredential` works with zero setup. Tenant-rooted at the base URL (`/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token`, where `{tenant}` may be a tenant id or `common`/`organizations`/`consumers`); the token response shape (`token_type`/`expires_in`/`ext_expires_in`/`access_token`) is preserved so existing Terraform/OpenTofu compatibility is unaffected. Enabled by default; incoming-token enforcement (`validate-tokens`) stays opt-in/off so existing services keep accepting any Bearer token in dev. App-registration management, Microsoft Graph CRUD, and interactive flows (device code, auth code + PKCE) follow in later phases ([#23](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/23))
- **compat (az cli):** new Azure CLI compatibility suite (`compatibility-tests/compat-azcli`, BATS) that registers a custom `az cloud` pointing at floci-az and runs `az login --service-principal` against the Entra token endpoint, then exercises resource group, storage account (+ blob data-plane), Key Vault (+ secret data-plane), virtual network/NIC, ACR, and Redis through the real `az` CLI. Wired into `make test-azcli`, `make compat-docker`, and the `compatibility.yml` CI matrix
- **arm:** management-plane endpoints used by the `az` CLI during sign-in and resource creation — `GET /subscriptions` and `GET /tenants` (list), and `Microsoft.*/checkNameAvailability` (returns available)
- **arm, network:** `enabled` true/false flags so every service can be toggled (closing the last config gaps). `FLOCI_AZ_SERVICES_NETWORK_ENABLED=false` gates all of Microsoft.Network (VNet, subnets, NIC, public IP, NSG, and DNS zones) — `/providers/Microsoft.Network/...` then returns `404` while the rest of ARM keeps working. `FLOCI_AZ_SERVICES_ARM_ENABLED=false` turns off the entire ARM management plane (and therefore every ARM-based service). Both default to `true`; the cosmetic `cosmos-engine` service type is now gated on `cosmos.enabled` as well
- **sql, functions, cosmos:** uniform `mocked` true/false flag so every Docker-backed service has the same explicit on/off switch (matching vm/acr/redis/aks/servicebus/eventhub). Default `false`. `FLOCI_AZ_SERVICES_SQL_MOCKED=true` creates servers in state with `state=Ready`, no `azure-sql-edge` container and no EULA required (data plane unavailable). `FLOCI_AZ_SERVICES_FUNCTIONS_MOCKED=true` keeps the management plane (deploy/list/get/delete) working with no runtime container; invocations return a synthetic `200` stub. `FLOCI_AZ_SERVICES_COSMOS_MOCKED=true` is a master switch that forces all engine containers off (equivalent to `engines.startup=disabled`); the in-process NoSQL/Table paths are unaffected

### Changed

- **identity:** the OAuth2 token endpoints (`/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token`, `common/...`) now return a genuine signed JWT served by the Entra service instead of a fixed unsigned stub token; `metadata/endpoints` ARM environment discovery is unchanged

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- **acr:** Azure Container Registry emulation (`Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries`) — registry lifecycle (CreateOrUpdate, Get, Patch, List by subscription and resource group, Delete), `listCredentials` / `regenerateCredential`, `listUsages`, and `checkNameAvailability`. Non-mocked mode backs all registries with a single shared `registry:2` sidecar exposing the Docker Registry HTTP API V2; registries are isolated by an internal repository prefix, so `loginServer` is path-style (`localhost:{port}/{name}`, not `{name}.azurecr.io`) and standard `docker push`/`pull` work against it. The shared registry runs anonymous (admin credentials are issued but not enforced at the data plane). Registries provision asynchronously (`Creating` → `Succeeded` once `GET /v2/` answers); mocked mode (default in tests) is management-plane only. Compatibility: Terraform/OpenTofu `azurerm_container_registry` suites and a Python data-plane push/pull test
- **redis:** Azure Cache for Redis emulation (`Microsoft.Cache/redis`) — cache lifecycle (CreateOrUpdate, Get, Patch, List by subscription and resource group, Delete) plus `listKeys` and `regenerateKey`. Non-mocked mode backs each cache with a real `valkey/valkey:8-alpine` sidecar container (a drop-in, RESP-compatible Redis fork) that standard Redis clients connect to; the primary access key is the Redis password (`--requirepass`) and both keys authenticate via a `default`-user ACL. Caches provision asynchronously (`Creating` → `Succeeded` once the container answers `PING`); mocked mode (default in tests) is management-plane only. Compatibility: Terraform/OpenTofu `azurerm_redis_cache` suites and a Python redis-py data-plane test
- **appconfig:** 2024-09-01 data-plane parity for the behaviors SDK clients exercise — server-side pagination (`@nextLink` / `Link` header with opaque `after` continuation, 100 items per page), `$select` field projection, `tags` filtering (repeatable, AND semantics) on key-value and revision lists, `Accept-Datetime` time-travel resolved from revision history, a `Sync-Token` consistency header on every response, and true async snapshot provisioning (`PUT` returns `provisioning` + `Operation-Location`; `GET /operations` reports `Succeeded` and flips the snapshot to `ready`) plus conditional `If-Match`/`If-None-Match` on `GetSnapshot`. Adds a `queryParamsMulti` accessor to `AzureRequest` so repeated query params (`tags`) survive routing. Compatibility: extended Java and Python `azure-appconfiguration` suites and a new Node `@azure/app-configuration` suite
- **vm:** Azure Virtual Machines emulation (`Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines`) — VM lifecycle (CreateOrUpdate, Get, List by subscription and resource group, UpdateTags, Delete), power actions (`start`, `powerOff`, `deallocate`, `restart`, `redeploy`, `reapply`), `instanceView` reporting `ProvisioningState/*` and `PowerState/*`, and `?$expand=instanceView`. Power actions return `202` with an `Azure-AsyncOperation` header and a terminal operation-status endpoint for SDK LRO polling. Mocked mode (default) requires no Docker; container-backed VMs are planned ([#19](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/issues/19))
- **arm:** `Microsoft.Network` dependency stubs — virtual networks, subnets, network interfaces (synthesized private IP), public IP addresses, and network security groups, so Terraform's `azurerm_linux_virtual_machine` and its dependencies apply end-to-end
- **arm:** Terraform/OpenTofu compatibility suite extended with a Linux virtual machine and its network dependencies

### Changed

- **acr, redis:** Docker backing is now **on by default** (`mocked: false`) — creating a registry or cache starts a real container (a shared `registry:2` for ACR, a `valkey/valkey:8-alpine` container per cache for Redis). Set `FLOCI_AZ_SERVICES_ACR_MOCKED=true` / `FLOCI_AZ_SERVICES_REDIS_MOCKED=true` to restore management-plane-only mode. Unit tests pin `mocked=true` via test profiles and remain Docker-free.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- **arm:** Azure Resource Manager management-plane emulation — ARM routing on `management.azure.com`-style paths; resource group CRUD (`Microsoft.Resources`); storage account + blob/queue/table endpoint resolution (`Microsoft.Storage`); Key Vault CRUD with vault URI (`Microsoft.KeyVault`); subscription and resource-group list endpoints; OAuth token endpoint (`/oauth2/token`) returning a synthetic bearer token accepted by the ARM routing layer ([#40](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/40))
- **arm:** Terraform compatibility — `azurerm` provider `~> 4.0`; `make compat-terraform` target; BATS test suite covering resource group, storage account, storage container, storage queue, Key Vault, and Key Vault secret via Terraform apply/destroy ([#40](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/40))
- **arm:** OpenTofu compatibility — identical BATS suite against OpenTofu `tofu` CLI; `make compat-opentofu` target ([#40](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/40))

### Fixed

- **blob:** Large blob uploads beyond 20 MB now work correctly — raised Quarkus HTTP body limit to `2G` (`quarkus.http.limits.max-body-size`) and Jackson string-length limit to 512 MB; implemented block blob protocol (`PUT ?comp=block` / `PUT ?comp=blocklist`) so the Azure SDK's chunked multi-part upload path is fully supported ([#41](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/41))
- **functions:** All functions in a Function App now share a single container — pool keyed on `appKey` (`account/appName`) instead of per-function; `ContainerLauncher.launch()` injects every function's code at `wwwroot/{funcName}/` and writes a shared `host.json` before the container starts; previously N functions started N containers ([#42](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/42))

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **tls:** Dynamic self-signed certificate generation at runtime via BouncyCastle — no static cert bundled in the image; certs persist under `data/tls/` and regenerate automatically when hostname config changes (`FLOCI_AZ_HOSTNAME` or `FLOCI_AZ_BASE_URL`)
- **tls:** Protocol-sniffing `TlsProxyServer` — both HTTP and HTTPS served on the same public port `4577`; first byte `0x16` routes to the HTTPS backend, anything else to HTTP
- **tls:** `GET /_floci/tls-cert` endpoint — returns the active TLS certificate PEM so SDK clients and compat tests can dynamically install it into their truststores
- **tls:** `CertificateGenerator` — dedicated class (matching aws-local structure) responsible for X.509 self-signed cert generation with configurable SANs (hostname, IP, wildcard)
- **tls:** `BouncyCastleInitializer` — CDI `@Startup` bean that registers the BouncyCastle JCA provider at application startup
- **event-hubs:** Mocked namespace mode — management API returns `"mocked":true` when no Artemis broker is running; compat tests skip AMQP data-plane assertions gracefully via `Assumptions.assumeTrue`
- **compat (java):** `CosmosCompatibilityTest` now works in Docker compat runs — `EmulatorConfig.installEmulatorTlsCert()` fetches the emulator cert at test setup and installs it into a temp PKCS12 truststore; Netty forced to JDK SSL via `-Dio.netty.handler.ssl.noOpenSsl=true`

### Changed

- **tls:** Replaced static bundled certificates (`src/main/resources/certs/`) with runtime generation — removed `floci-az.crt`, `floci-az.key`, `floci-az.p12` from the image
- **tls:** `TlsConfigSource` delegates cert generation to `CertificateGenerator` instead of inlining BouncyCastle calls
- **build:** Added GraalVM `--initialize-at-run-time` flags for BouncyCastle classes (`DRBG`, `SP800SecureRandom`, `KeyPairGeneratorSpi`, `CertificateFactory`) and `CertificateGenerator` to support native image builds
- **ci:** Compatibility workflow now starts the emulator with `FLOCI_AZ_TLS_ENABLED=true` and `FLOCI_AZ_HOSTNAME=floci-az` — required for Cosmos Java SDK which enforces HTTPS in gateway mode
- **compat (java):** Removed static `floci-az.p12` truststore from test resources — truststore is now built dynamically from the live emulator cert

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **aks:** Azure Kubernetes Service emulation — CreateOrUpdate, Get, Delete, List (by subscription and by resource group), UpdateTags, agent pool CRUD, `listClusterAdminCredential` / `listClusterUserCredential`; ARM path routing on `Microsoft.ContainerService`
- **aks:** Real k3s mode — each cluster starts a privileged `rancher/k3s` container; background readiness poller transitions `provisioningState` from `Creating` → `Succeeded`; kubeconfig with real CA extracted from the container
- **aks:** Mocked mode (`FLOCI_AZ_SERVICES_AKS_MOCKED=true`) — clusters immediately reach `Succeeded` with a synthetic kubeconfig; no Docker required; suitable for unit tests and CI without Docker
- **aks:** `instanceId`-based container naming (`floci-az-aks-{instanceId}`) — 8-char UUID prefix per cluster prevents naming collisions when the same cluster name exists across resource groups
- **aks:** 10 unit tests (`AksHandlerTest`) covering full CRUD in mocked mode; 5 Docker integration tests (`AksDockerTest`) with `@TestProfile(mocked=false)` exercising real k3s start, readiness poll, kubeconfig extraction, and deletion

- **cosmos:** Azure Cosmos DB SQL API emulator — always-on at `/{account}-cosmos/`; databases, containers, and document CRUD; full SQL dialect (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `OFFSET LIMIT`, `SELECT TOP`, `SELECT DISTINCT`); aggregates (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`); string, math, array, and type-check functions; named parameters; `PATCH` document operations; transactional batch; server-side pagination with continuation tokens; system properties (`_rid`, `_self`, `_etag`, `_ts`) auto-generated on every write ([#16](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/16))
- **cosmos:** Modular multi-API engine support — opt-in per API via environment variable; Docker-backed: MongoDB (`mongo:7`), PostgreSQL/Citus (`citusdata/citus`), Cassandra (`scylladb/scylla:6.2`), Gremlin (`tinkerpop/gremlin-server`); embedded (no Docker): NoSQL in-process SQL engine, Table in-memory OData; each engine exposes a `/connect` endpoint returning its connection string ([#16](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/16))
- **cosmos:** HTTPS proxy on port `4578` with bundled self-signed certificate (`CN=localhost`, valid 100 years) — required for the Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK which enforces TLS in gateway mode; no certificate import needed ([#16](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/16))
- **cosmos:** Java compatibility tests — `CosmosCompatibilityTest` (SQL API CRUD + queries), `CosmosNoSqlEngineCompatibilityTest` (embedded NoSQL engine), `CosmosMongoEngineCompatibilityTest`, `CosmosPostgresEngineCompatibilityTest`, `CosmosCassandraEngineCompatibilityTest`, `CosmosGremlinEngineCompatibilityTest`, `CosmosTableEngineCompatibilityTest` ([#16](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/16))
- **table:** OData `$filter` / `$select` / `$top` query support — operators `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `ge`, `lt`, `le`, `and`, `or`, `not`; functions `startswith`, `endswith`, `substringof`; typed property annotations (`Edm.Int64`, `Edm.DateTime`, `Edm.Guid`, etc.)
- **table:** ETag optimistic concurrency — `If-Match: *` and `If-Match: "<etag>"` honoured on `PUT`, `MERGE`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`; `412 Precondition Failed` on mismatch
- **table:** Entity Group Transactions (`$batch`) — atomic execution of multiple operations against a single partition key; full rollback on any failure; standard Azure `multipart/mixed` wire format
- **table:** Server-side pagination with `NextPartitionKey` / `NextRowKey` continuation tokens
- **event-hubs:** Multi-namespace support — each Event Hubs namespace gets its own isolated Artemis container with dynamically allocated ports; default namespace starts on-demand via `PUT /{account}-eventhub/namespaces/{ns}`
- **event-hubs:** Namespace management REST API — `GET/PUT/DELETE /{account}-eventhub/namespaces[/{ns}]`; `GET /{account}-eventhub/namespaces/{ns}/connection` returns AMQP/AMQPS ports and Kafka bootstrap when running; `GET /{account}-eventhub/namespaces/{ns}/tls-cert` returns TLS PEM
- **event-hubs:** ANYCAST + exclusive divert topology embedded in `broker.xml` — durable queues per consumer group ensure messages persist before a receiver connects; Jolokia setup runs asynchronously after broker start
- **event-hubs:** `ArtemisConfigGenerator` generates `broker.xml` per namespace; `ArtemisTlsGenerator` generates self-signed RSA-2048 cert + PKCS12 keystore per namespace for TLS AMQP
- **event-hubs:** Java AMQP compatibility tests (`EventHubCompatibilityTest`, `EventHubNamespaceManagementTest`) replacing previous Python uamqp suite
- **event-hubs:** Kafka (`EventHubsKafkaManager`) starts on-demand when a namespace is created with `kafkaEnabled: true`; idempotent, synchronized, resolves broker address correctly inside and outside Docker
- **docker:** `ContainerSpec`, `ContainerBuilder`, `ContainerLifecycleManager`, `ImageCacheService`, `PortAllocator` ported from floci — shared container infrastructure for sidecar-based services

### Changed

- **docs:** README restructured to match floci (aws-local) format — nav links, "What is?", Features section, SDK examples collapsed per language, Migrating from Azurite, Star History, Contributors
- **docs:** `mkdocs.yml` — added Cosmos DB service page; moved `application.yml Reference` under `Advanced` subsection
- **docker:** Added OCI image labels (`org.opencontainers.image.*`, `io.k8s.*`, `io.openshift.*`) to `Dockerfile.jvm-package` and `Dockerfile.native-package`
- **build:** Removed stale `test-appconfig` Makefile target and `APPCONFIG_DIR` variable — AppConfig tests are covered by `test-python` and `test-java-compat`

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-15


### Added

- **key-vault:** Azure Key Vault Secrets service — CRUD, versioning (immutable versions with latest pointer), soft-delete lifecycle (delete → recover or purge), properties update (`content_type`, `tags`, `enabled`, `nbf`, `exp`), list secrets/versions/deleted, backup ([#16](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/16))
- **key-vault:** 24 Python (`azure-keyvault-secrets 4.11.0`) compatibility tests covering secrets CRUD, versioning, soft-delete, enabled attribute, and backup ([#16](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/16))
- **app-config:** Azure App Configuration service — key-values, labels, feature flags, snapshots (frozen KV sets), revisions, ETags, and optimistic-concurrency locks ([#15](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/15))
- **app-config:** Snapshot lifecycle — `PUT /snapshots/{name}` captures a frozen set of key-values; `GET /operations?snapshot={name}` returns the LRO result; `GET /kv?snapshot={name}` reads from the frozen set; supports `key` and `key_label` composition modes ([#15](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/15))
- **app-config:** 36 Python (`azure-appconfiguration 1.7.1`) and 36 Java compatibility tests covering KV, labels, feature flags, ETags, locks, and snapshots ([#15](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/15))
- **docker:** `CurrentContainerNetworkResolver` — detects which Docker network floci-az itself is on when running inside a container, improving function container IP resolution ([#14](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/14))
- **docker:** `DockerClientProducer` gains `normalizeDockerHost()` (prepends `tcp://` when scheme is missing) and `resolveEffectiveDockerHost()` (prefers `DOCKER_HOST` env over config default) — fixes connectivity in Bitbucket Pipelines and similar CI environments ([#14](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/14))
- **functions:** `FLOCI_AZ_SERVICES_FUNCTIONS_DOCKER_HOST_OVERRIDE` env var — explicitly override the hostname function containers use to reach floci-az ([#14](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/14))

### Fixed

- **docker:** `ContainerDetector.hasMountInfoMarkers()` now only checks lines where the filesystem is mounted at root (`/`), preventing false positives in some cgroup configurations ([#14](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/14))
- **functions:** `WarmPool` field renamed to `maxPoolSizePerFunction`; eviction scheduler renamed to `evictionScheduler`; idle timeout config key renamed from `idle-timeout-ms` to `container-idle-timeout-seconds` (value now in seconds, default `300`) ([#14](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/14))
- **storage:** `HybridStorage`, `PersistentStorage`, and `WalStorage` — replaced `.toList()` with `Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new)` for GraalVM native-image compatibility ([#14](https://github.com/floci-io/floci-az/pull/14))

### Dependencies

- Bump `actions/setup-python` from 5 to 6
- Bump `actions/setup-java` from 4 to 5

### Changed

- **ci:** Release workflow restructured with SHA-pinned actions and a single multi-arch native build (replaces separate per-arch builds)
- **docker:** Dockerfile aligned with floci structure — dedicated `floci` user, correct `/app/data` permissions, ENTRYPOINT wired through `docker/entrypoint.sh`

---

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-23
